    "summary" : "The underlying thread of my work has been the analysis of complex biological systems to understand and control them in order to improve human health. A focal point of this work has been the usage of molecular networks and pathways as a means of integrating and analyzing wide-scale changes in cellular processes in response to external stimuli (e.g. drug response) and alterations (e.g. mutations) through statistical and mechanistic models. Additionally, I have worked to facilitate wide dissemination of scientific data and software tools. I have done this through work on standardized representations of biological data (e.g. the Biological Pathway Exchange format and the Systems Biology Graphical Notation) and the development (and by mentoring student projects) of software tools to visualize and analyze biological networks.
